Required parameters (must follow options):
source_file: Source image file, in any format stb_image.c supports.
dest_file: Destination JPEG file.
quality_factor: 1-100, higher=better (only needed in compression mode)

Default mode compresses source_file to dest_file. Alternate modes:
-x: Exhaustive compression test (only needs source_file)
-d: Test jpgd.h. source_file must be JPEG, and dest_file must be .TGA



Example usages:
Open jpeg-compressor_v104_r1\bin on terminal if Os is windows;
Open jpeg-compressor_v104_r1\bin_linux on terminal if Os is linux;
Open jpeg-compressor_v104_r1\bin_mingw on terminal if on mingw environment;
Test compression: jpge egg.bmp egg_compressed.jpg 90
Test decompression: jpge -d egg_compressed.jpg egg_decompressed.tga  
Exhaustively test compressor: jpge -x egg.bmp
